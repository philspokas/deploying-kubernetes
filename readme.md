# Deploying to Kubernetes

Material prepared for Spokane DevOps Meetup

We're using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for demos, principals apply regardless of platform.

## Pre-requisites for Demos
* Pre-provisioned AKS Cluster (commands included) and Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Azure CLI 2.26 or later
* Kubectl command line (comes with Docker for Windows)

Sample commands are in PowerShell, easy to substitute bash
Sample repo uses GitHub Actions, similar concepts apply to other CI/CD
